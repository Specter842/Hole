"""Fill and submit application forms in a real browser.

Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, SmartRecruiters, Recruitee, BreezyHR,
JazzHR, BambooHR, Personio, Teamtailor, Rippling, and Jobvite are recognized by
host. Most of the work here is ATS-agnostic -- required fields are found by
their DOM properties and filled by the label a person reads -- so the boards
without a hand-written selector map are filled by the same generic path.

Needs Playwright:

    pip install playwright
    playwright install chromium

Design constraints, all of which mean "stop rather than guess":

- It fills only fields it recognizes. A required field it cannot map is an abort,
  not a blank submission or an invented answer.
- It never attempts a CAPTCHA. If one is present the run stops and the
  application goes to the review queue for you to finish by hand.
- It screenshots the completed form before submitting, so every unattended
  submission has an artifact you can look at afterwards.
- Demographic and voluntary self-identification questions are left untouched.
